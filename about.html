        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>SmilePlease was created to spread joy and laughter. Our goal is simple: make people smile, one joke at a time! Whether you're having a tough day or just need a little pick-me-up, we're here to help.</p>
        
        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <p>Each time you visit, we present you with a randomly selected joke or humorous image. Click on "Try again" to see another joke, or let us know if we made you smile by clicking "Yes, I smiled". Your smiles are counted and shared with our community.</p>
